To manually check if the admin user exists in your MongoDB database, follow these steps:

1. Open your MongoDB shell or use a MongoDB GUI tool like MongoDB Compass.

2. Connect to your database.

3. Run the following query in the "users" collection (or the collection where your User model stores data):

```js
db.users.find({ email: "admin@local.com" }).pretty()
```

4. Check if a document is returned with the email "admin@local.com".

5. Verify the "password" field contains a hashed string (not the plain password).

If the document does not exist, the admin user was not created.

If the document exists but login still fails, the password hash might not match the plain password "admin123".

You can delete the existing admin user document and re-run the admin creation script to recreate it.

If you need help with any of these steps, please let me know.
